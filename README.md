# CatPhotoApp
A JavaScript application that allows one view an infinite number of cat images.

Using a JavaScript function, invoked everytime the button is clicked, the app interacts with an API and returns (cute) data.
A new image of adorable kitties is displayed each time.

So, if you're an ailurophile or just simply bored out of your mind, CatFeverApp might be the thing for you.

For a date with raw, unadulterated joy (at the click of a button), follow this link to the hosted page  => https://npdebs.github.io/CatPhotoApp/
